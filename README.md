Navigate to the splunk website in your VM and download splunk enterprise. It can be found  

[here](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download.html?utm_campaign=google_amer_en_search_brand&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=free_trials_downloads&utm_term=splunk%20free&device=c&_bt=662330344243&_bm=p&_bn=g&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiA1p28BhCBARIsADP9HrMeXO3BO27U8uvJd3ZGtVBdH94JRZ-JBDfISjaXFzGBvjKKrn-NFRoaAu0dEALw_wcB)

Create a username and password for logging into the web app. Once you have created an account, select a web browser for the app to open in. Once the app is open, log in with the credentials you have created earlier.

Once you have reached this landing page, we now need to set our logs up to be ingested within the tool. Navigate to the settings tab in the top right corner, then select Data Inputs, and click on the edit button next to local event log collection. In this lab we will only deal with local events, instead of a remote system.

In this project, we will only focus on the application, security, and system logs, because those are the basic logs used in most, if not all SIEMS, Once you have selected these three be sure to click on Save.

Navigate to the apps button in the top left corner, and click on the drop down to go to search and reporting. Start a new search by entering the asterisk or star key in the search bar and pressing enter. This is to display all the known events on the local system .

Next open up the Event Viewer in Windows, click on the Windows log drop-down, right click on security, and then select clear logs. We would like to clear the logs so that we can view the event of logs being cleared within Splunk.

For this lab, we will be adding the host, source, and event code parameters to the search. This means we are specifying events only on this computer, from the windows event viewer security logs, With an event code of 1102. Notice the message on the event says the audit log was cleared. Now we have an event that shows an action we did ourselves in Splunk. Be sure to copy the search parameters from the search bar and paste it into a notepad, as we will need this specific query later on. Now click on the "Create Table View" button in the top right corner.

We now have a table created showing a simplified version of all the fields we have selected.You can use the left hand side to add or remove fields to this table. the raw field is added by default, but I removed it for simplicity. Once you are finished adding or removing fields, click on "Done" on the left hand side.

  Select the dashboard tab in the top left corner, then select create new dashboard. I have labeled my dashboard clear logs, but you can name it whatever you want. In this project we use dashboard Studio to create the dashboard after this I selected the grid option.

Select the add Charts button, which is the icon of two bars and it is directly under the analytics tab in the top left corner. From here, select table, and notice on the right hand side, once the table is selected there is a field titled “search with SPL” , this is where you want to paste the query we copied from earlier. Once you enter your search select "Apply and close"

I wanted to remove the bkt and CD fields and add a field for the error code and message. Using search processing language, I was able to complete that as you can see on the right hand side.  With a better understanding of search processing language, you too can customize your table to better fit your needs.
